# Hand-Landmark-Detection

The Hand Landmark Detection OpenCV Python was developed using Python OpenCV, In this Python Project With Source Code we are going to learn how to obtain hand landmarks from an web cam, using Python, MediaPipe and OpenCV.

# What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks.

A OpenCV Python Hand Landmark Detection, We will be using OpenCV to read the image and displaying it and MediaPipe to perform the hand detection and landmark estimation. In short, MediaPipe is a free and open-source framework that offers cross-platform, customizable Machine Learning solutions for live and streaming media.
